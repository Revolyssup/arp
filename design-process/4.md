# Refactoring

- The initial implemenation had few components mixed up inside Listener and it wasn't easy to test them independently. So in this refactor, components have been cleanly separated out and unit tests have been added for them.

- Maybe converting every app into a CLI isn't that great of an idea and seems like unnecessary bloat addition, I'm still going ahead and using cobra CLI that will create an ARP instance for the sake of being idiomatic I guess :)

- Proper routine handling via waitgroups and context cancellation was intentionally ignored initially and is being added now.
